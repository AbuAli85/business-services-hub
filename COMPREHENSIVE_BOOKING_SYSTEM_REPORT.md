WITH booking_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
    COUNT(*) as daily_bookings,
    AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) 
                        ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) as avg_7day,
    STDDEV(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) 
                          ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) as stddev_7day
  FROM bookings 
  WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
)
SELECT 
  day,
  daily_bookings,
  CASE 
    WHEN daily_bookings > (avg_7day + 2 * stddev_7day) THEN 'anomaly_high'
    WHEN daily_bookings < (avg_7day - 2 * stddev_7day) THEN 'anomaly_low'
    ELSE 'normal'
  END as anomaly_type
FROM booking_stats;
```
