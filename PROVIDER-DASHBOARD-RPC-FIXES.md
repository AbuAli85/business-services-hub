# Provider Dashboard RPC Functions Fix

## Issues Identified

The provider dashboard was failing with several RPC function errors:

1. **400 errors** on `get_provider_dashboard`, `get_provider_top_services`
2. **404 errors** on `get_provider_recent_bookings`
3. **400 errors** on direct services queries

## Root Causes

1. **Schema Mismatches**: RPC functions were referencing columns that don't exist in the actual database schema
2. **Conflicting RLS Policies**: Multiple overlapping RLS policies on the services table causing access issues
3. **Missing Columns**: Bookings table missing `title`, `description`, `start_time`, `end_time` columns
4. **Incorrect Table References**: Functions referencing `clients` table instead of `profiles`
5. **Email Access**: No direct email column in profiles table

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Columns to Bookings Table
- Added `title` column
- Added `description` column  
- Added `start_time` column
- Added `end_time` column

### 2. Fixed RPC Functions
- Updated `get_provider_dashboard` to use correct column names and table references
- Fixed `get_provider_recent_bookings` to join with `profiles` and `auth.users` for email access
- Updated `get_provider_top_services` to use `base_price` instead of `price`
- Fixed `get_provider_monthly_earnings` to use correct table structure

### 3. Cleaned Up RLS Policies
- Removed all conflicting policies on services table
- Created clean, simple policies:
  - Anyone can read active services
  - Providers can manage their own services
  - Admins can manage all services

### 4. Fixed Table References
- Changed `clients` references to `profiles`
- Added proper joins with `auth.users` for email access
- Updated all column references to match actual schema

## Files Created/Modified

1. `supabase/migrations/102_fix_provider_dashboard_rpc_complete.sql` - Main RPC function fixes
2. `supabase/migrations/103_fix_services_rls_policies.sql` - RLS policy cleanup
3. `test-rpc-functions.js` - Test script to verify fixes

## Next Steps

1. Apply the migrations to the database
2. Test the RPC functions using the test script
3. Verify the provider dashboard loads without errors
4. Check that all data displays correctly

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all RPC functions work:

```bash
node test-rpc-functions.js
```

The script will test all four RPC functions and a direct services query to ensure everything is working properly.
