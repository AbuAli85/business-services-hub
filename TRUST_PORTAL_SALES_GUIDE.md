## 🎯 Objection Handling

### "We don't need this level of transparency"
**Response**: "That's exactly what we thought until we realized how much time and money our clients save on vendor risk assessments. One client reduced their security review time from 3 weeks to 2 days using our portal."

### "Our current vendor is fine"
**Response**: "I understand. But consider this: when was the last time you could verify your current vendor's uptime in real-time? Or access their security documentation without going through sales? Our portal gives you that visibility 24/7."

### "This seems like overkill"
**Response**: "Actually, this is becoming the standard for enterprise vendors. Companies like Atlassian, Okta, and AWS all provide similar transparency. We're just making it easier and more comprehensive."

### "We have our own security team"
**Response**: "Perfect! Our portal is designed for security teams. It gives them instant access to all the information they need without back-and-forth. One security director told us it saved them 20 hours per audit."
