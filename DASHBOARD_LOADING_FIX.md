# Dashboard Loading Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Dashboard Loading Issue
The client dashboard (`/dashboard/client`) was stuck on "Loading dashboard..." screen and never completing the load process.

### 2. Main Dashboard Loading Issue  
The main admin dashboard (`/dashboard`) was stuck on "Loading..." when navigating from provider or client dashboards.

## Root Causes

### Client Dashboard Issue
The `checkUserAndFetchData()` function had multiple early return points where `setLoading(false)` was not being called before redirecting users. This caused the loading state to persist indefinitely when:

1. User authentication failed
2. User role was not 'client' (e.g., provider or admin users)
3. User role check required a database query

### Main Dashboard Issue
The main dashboard's `useEffect` had a session storage check that would return early without running the auth check or clearing the loading state:

```typescript
if (sessionStorage.getItem('dashboard-provider-loaded') === 'true') {
  console.log('⚠️ Provider dashboard already loaded, skipping main dashboard auth check')
  return  // ❌ Loading state never cleared, auth never run
}
```

Additionally, the `hasCheckedAuth` ref persisted across navigation, preventing the auth check from running when returning to `/dashboard`.

## Changes Made

### Client Dashboard (`/dashboard/client`)

#### 1. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive console logging throughout the authentication and data loading flow:
- Component mount tracking
- User authentication status
- Role verification steps
- Data loading progress
- Error states

#### 2. Fixed Loading State Management
**Before:**
```typescript
if (userError || !user) {
  router.push('/auth/sign-in')
  return  // ❌ Loading state never cleared
}

if (userRole !== 'client') {
  router.push(dashboardUrl)
  return  // ❌ Loading state never cleared
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (userError || !user) {
  console.log('❌ Client dashboard: No user found, redirecting to sign-in')
  setLoading(false)  // ✅ Clear loading state
  router.push('/auth/sign-in')
  return
}

if (userRole !== 'client') {
  console.log(`🔀 Client dashboard: User is ${userRole}, redirecting to appropriate dashboard`)
  setLoading(false)  // ✅ Clear loading state
  window.location.href = dashboardUrl  // Use hard redirect
  return
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Role Verification
Added fallback role checking logic:
1. Check `user.user_metadata?.role` first
2. If not found, query the `profiles` table
3. If still not found, default to 'client' (backwards compatibility)

```typescript
let userRole = user.user_metadata?.role

if (!userRole) {
  console.log('🔍 Client dashboard: No role in metadata, checking profiles table...')
  const { data: profileData } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()
  
  if (profileData) {
    userRole = profileData.role
  }
}

if (!userRole) {
  userRole = 'client'  // Default fallback
}
```

### 4. Improved Redirect Logic
Changed from `router.push()` to `window.location.href` for role-based redirects to ensure clean page transitions and avoid routing issues.

#### 5. Better Error Handling
Ensured all error paths call `setLoading(false)` to prevent infinite loading states:
- Authentication errors
- Role verification errors
- Data fetching errors

### Main Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

#### 1. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed console logging to track:
- useEffect triggers
- Session storage state
- Auth check flow
- Navigation state

#### 2. Fixed Session Storage Check
**Before:**
```typescript
if (sessionStorage.getItem('dashboard-provider-loaded') === 'true') {
  console.log('⚠️ Provider dashboard already loaded, skipping main dashboard auth check')
  return  // ❌ No auth check, loading state stuck
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const wasOnProviderDashboard = sessionStorage.getItem('dashboard-provider-loaded') === 'true'
const wasOnClientDashboard = sessionStorage.getItem('dashboard-client-loaded') === 'true'

if (wasOnProviderDashboard || wasOnClientDashboard) {
  console.log('🧹 Clearing dashboard flags and resetting auth check')
  sessionStorage.removeItem('dashboard-provider-loaded')
  sessionStorage.removeItem('dashboard-client-loaded')
  hasCheckedAuth.current = false  // ✅ Reset to allow auth check
}
```

#### 3. Reset Auth Check on Navigation
When returning to `/dashboard` from provider or client dashboards:
1. Clear session storage flags
2. Reset `hasCheckedAuth.current` to `false`
3. Allow auth check to run again
4. Properly redirect or load based on user role

## Testing

### To Verify the Client Dashboard Fix:
1. **As a Provider User**: Navigate to `/dashboard/client` → Should redirect to `/dashboard/provider`
2. **As a Client User**: Navigate to `/dashboard/client` → Should load client dashboard
3. **As an Admin User**: Navigate to `/dashboard/client` → Should redirect to `/dashboard`
4. **Unauthenticated**: Navigate to `/dashboard/client` → Should redirect to `/auth/sign-in`

### To Verify the Main Dashboard Fix:
1. **From Provider Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard` → Should run auth check and redirect based on role
2. **From Client Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard` → Should run auth check and redirect based on role
3. **As Admin User**: Navigate to `/dashboard` → Should load admin dashboard
4. **Direct Access**: Access `/dashboard` directly → Should check auth and redirect/load appropriately

### Console Logs to Watch:

**Client Dashboard:**
```
🏠 Client dashboard mounted, starting initialization
🚀 Client dashboard: Starting checkUserAndFetchData
✅ Client dashboard: Supabase client created
👤 Client dashboard: User check result: { hasUser: true, role: 'provider' }
🔀 Client dashboard: User is provider, redirecting to appropriate dashboard
```

**Main Dashboard:**
```
🔍 Main dashboard useEffect triggered: { pathname: '/dashboard', hasCheckedAuth: false, isRedirecting: false, providerLoaded: 'true', clientLoaded: null }
🧹 Clearing dashboard flags and resetting auth check
✅ First mount on /dashboard, running auth check
🔐 Main dashboard: Checking auth...
✅ User found in session: user@example.com
📋 Role from metadata: provider
🎭 Final role: provider
🔄 Redirecting provider to /dashboard/provider
```

## Files Modified
- `app/dashboard/client/page.tsx` - Fixed loading state and role verification
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed session storage handling and auth check reset

## Impact
- ✅ Prevents infinite loading states on both client and main dashboards
- ✅ Proper role-based redirects from all dashboard pages
- ✅ Better debugging with comprehensive logs
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Backwards compatible with users who don't have roles set
- ✅ Proper navigation between dashboard types (provider ↔ main ↔ client)
- ✅ Session storage properly managed across navigation

## Related Issues
This fix ensures that dashboards properly handle:
- Non-client users accessing the client dashboard
- Non-admin users accessing the main dashboard
- Missing role metadata
- Authentication failures
- Network errors during role verification
- Navigation from one dashboard to another
- Session storage flag cleanup
