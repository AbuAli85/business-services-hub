# User Registration to Login to Profile Workflow - Fixed

## Overview
This document outlines the complete end-to-end user workflow from registration to login to profile creation, including all fixes implemented.

## Fixed Workflow

### 1. User Registration (`/auth/sign-up`)
**Flow:**
1. User fills registration form with:
   - Email, password, full name, phone, company name
   - Role selection (client/provider)
   - Password strength validation
   - hCaptcha verification

2. **Fixed:** Email confirmation handling
   - If email already confirmed → Direct redirect to onboarding
   - If email needs confirmation → Show verification modal
   - After modal close → Redirect to sign-in (user must sign in after confirming)

3. **Fixed:** Profile creation via webhook
   - Supabase webhook calls `/api/auth/profile-creation`
   - Uses `create_user_profile` RPC function
   - Handles both 3-parameter and 5-parameter versions

### 2. Email Verification
**Flow:**
1. User receives confirmation email
2. Clicks link → Redirected to `/auth/callback`
3. **Fixed:** Auth callback handler (`/auth/callback/route.ts`)
   - Exchanges code for session
   - Checks if profile exists
   - Redirects to onboarding if no profile
   - Redirects to dashboard if profile exists

### 3. User Login (`/auth/sign-in`)
**Flow:**
1. User enters email/password
2. **Fixed:** Enhanced error handling
   - Rate limiting (5 attempts max)
   - Specific error messages for different failure types
   - Email confirmation check before allowing login

3. **Fixed:** Role verification
   - Checks user metadata for role
   - Falls back to profile table if no role in metadata
   - Redirects to onboarding if no role found

4. **Fixed:** Google OAuth support
   - Proper redirect handling
   - Callback processing

### 4. Onboarding (`/auth/onboarding`)
**Flow:**
1. **Fixed:** Profile creation verification
   - Uses RPC function for consistent profile creation
   - Handles both new and existing profiles
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

2. **Fixed:** Company creation
   - Creates company for both clients and providers
   - Links company to user profile
   - Handles missing profile scenarios

3. **Fixed:** Multi-step process
   - Step 1: Basic info (company name, billing preferences)
   - Step 2: Bio and profile image (coming soon)
   - Step 3: Portfolio and services (providers only)

### 5. Dashboard Access (`/dashboard`)
**Flow:**
1. **Fixed:** Enhanced authentication check
   - Session validation
   - Role verification with fallback
   - Profile existence check

2. **Fixed:** Profile verification component
   - Checks if profile exists
   - Validates profile completeness
   - Provides creation/completion options

3. **Fixed:** Role-based navigation
   - Dynamic navigation based on user role
   - Proper access control

### 6. Profile Management (`/dashboard/profile`)
**Flow:**
1. **Fixed:** Comprehensive profile editing
   - Basic information (name, phone, country, bio)
   - Professional details (skills, experience, education)
   - Company information display
   - Logo upload functionality

2. **Fixed:** Profile completion tracking
   - Real-time completion percentage
   - Missing field indicators
   - Save/update functionality
