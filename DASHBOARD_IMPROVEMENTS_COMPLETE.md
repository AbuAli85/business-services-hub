## üêõ **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED & FIXED**

### Issue: API Data Being Overwritten
**File:** `lib/dashboard-data.ts`

**Problem:** Even though the Services API was correctly returning `booking_count` and `total_revenue`, the `calculateServiceBookingCounts()` method was **overwriting** this data with locally calculated values (which were often 0 because local bookings array was empty or incomplete).

**Impact:** This explains why My Services showed 0 despite the API having correct data!

**Fix:** Modified the method to:
- ‚úÖ Check if API already provided booking_count and total_revenue
- ‚úÖ Preserve API data if it exists
- ‚úÖ Only calculate locally if API data is missing
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive logging to track which source is used

**Code Added:**
- Checks for API data before calculating
- Preserves `service.booking_count` and `service.total_revenue` from API
- Falls back to local calculation only when needed
- Logs which source was used for each service

**Also Fixed:**
- Added `total_revenue` field to service mapping in `lib/dashboard-data.ts` (was missing!)
- Enhanced stats calculation in `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx` to use service revenue
- Added debugging to service cards to track data flow
