## 🎯 Workflow Steps

### When Admin Approves a Service:

1. **UI Update** (Optimistic)
   - Service status → "approved"
   - Service row shows green background + pulse animation
   - Badge changes to "✅ Just Approved"
   - Stats counters update

2. **Database Update**
   - `services.approval_status` → "approved"
   - `services.status` → "active"
   - `services.updated_at` → current timestamp

3. **Audit Log Creation**
   - Insert into `service_audit_logs`
   - Records actor info, event, metadata
   - Timestamp and service ID

4. **In-App Notification**
   - Insert into `notifications` table
   - Notification type: `service_approved`
   - Real-time delivery via Supabase

5. **Email Notification**
   - Generate HTML from template
   - Send via Resend API
   - To: Provider's email (testing: `chairman@falconeyegroup.net`)
   - From: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend default)
   - Reply-To: `chairman@falconeyegroup.net`

6. **UI Refresh**
   - Reload services list
   - Update stats
   - Clear loading states

## 📊 Database Schema

### `service_audit_logs` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE service_audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  service_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES services(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  event TEXT NOT NULL,
  actor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
  actor_name TEXT,
  actor_email TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### RLS Policies
```sql
-- Admins/managers can insert audit logs
CREATE POLICY "admin_insert_audit_logs" ON service_audit_logs
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'manager')
  )
);

-- Admins/managers can read all logs; providers can read their own
CREATE POLICY "admin_provider_read_audit_logs" ON service_audit_logs
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'manager')
  )
  OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM services 
    WHERE services.id = service_audit_logs.service_id 
    AND services.provider_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### RLS Policies Enforced
1. ✅ Only authenticated users with `admin` or `manager` role can:
   - Insert audit logs
   - View all audit logs
   - Approve/reject/suspend services

2. ✅ Providers can:
   - View audit logs for their own services
   - Receive notifications for their services

3. ✅ All operations validated server-side
   - Client-side optimistic updates for UX
   - Server validates role before executing

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Current Setup (Testing Mode)
- **Sender**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend default domain)
- **Recipient**: `chairman@falconeyegroup.net` (verified email)
- **Reply-To**: `chairman@falconeyegroup.net`

### Production Setup (After Domain Verification)
1. Verify your domain in Resend: https://resend.com/domains
2. Update sender email in `lib/service-email-templates.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const fromEmail = 'noreply@yourdomain.com'  // Your verified domain
   const recipientEmail = data.providerEmail    // Actual provider email
   ```

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Console Logs to Check
```javascript
// Service approval start
🚀 Starting approval for service: [id] [title]
🔍 Debug - Current actorId: [uuid]
🔍 Debug - Current actorName: [name]
🔍 Debug - Current actorEmail: [email]

// Optimistic update
✅ Optimistic update applied - service should now show as approved
📈 Stats updated optimistically

// Database update
✅ Database update successful

// Notifications & audit log
📧 Sending notifications and creating audit log...
🔍 Debug - Current auth user: [uuid]
🔍 Debug - User profile: {id, role, email, ...}
🔍 Debug - User role: admin
🔍 Debug - Is admin? true
✅ Audit log created successfully!

// Email
📧 Sending email to: chairman@falconeyegroup.net
📧 From: onboarding@resend.dev | Reply-To: chairman@falconeyegroup.net
✅ Service action email sent: approved to chairman@falconeyegroup.net

// Completion
🎉 Approval process completed successfully
🔄 Refreshing services list...
✅ Services list refreshed
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. "Permission denied for table service_audit_logs"
**Solution**: Run `FINAL_AUDIT_LOG_FIX.sql` to clean up RLS policies

#### 2. "The falconeyegroup.net domain is not verified"
**Solution**: Use Resend default domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) as sender

#### 3. "404 net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"
**Solution**: Use `window.location.origin` for API URL instead of hardcoded domain

#### 4. UI doesn't update after approval
**Solution**: Ensure optimistic updates are applied before API call
