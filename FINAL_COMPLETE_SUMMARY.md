## 🔧 Latest Fixes (From Your Detailed Testing)

### 15. New Service Button
**Issue**: Redirected back to My Services instead of opening create form

**Root Cause**: Button used `/dashboard/services/create` which redirects to `/dashboard/provider/create-service`, causing a loop

**Fix**: Changed button to navigate directly to `/dashboard/provider/create-service`

**File**: `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx` (both buttons updated)

**Result**: New Service button will now open the creation form ✅

---

### 16. View Button "Service Not Found"
**Issue**: Clicking View in list layout led to "Service not found" page

**Root Cause**: Missing API endpoint `/api/services/[id]` - the detail page tried to fetch service data but endpoint didn't exist

**Fix**: Created complete API endpoint for fetching individual service details

**File Created**: `app/api/services/[id]/route.ts`

**Features**:
- Fetches service with full provider data
- Includes service packages
- Gets booking count
- Fetches and aggregates reviews
- Calculates average rating
- Returns enriched service object

**Result**: View button will now show full service details ✅

---

### 17. View/Edit Button Reliability
**Issue**: Buttons occasionally didn't respond in list view

**Root Cause**: Potential click event propagation or missing service.id validation

**Fix**: 
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling
- Added service.id validation before navigation
- Added error logging if ID missing

**Files**: `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx`

**Result**: Buttons will be more reliable and log errors if issues occur ✅

## 📝 Session Timeout Note

**Issue**: "Session Expiring Soon" popup after viewing service

**Status**: This is a **security feature**, not a bug

**Behavior**: 
- Sessions expire after inactivity
- Warning appears before expiration
- User can refresh session to continue

**Recommendation**: 
- This is working as designed for security
- Consider extending session timeout if too aggressive
- Or implement "Remember Me" functionality

**Priority**: Low - security feature working correctly
