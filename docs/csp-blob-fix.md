# CSP Blob URL Fix

## Issue Identified âœ…

**Error**: `Refused to load the image 'blob:https://marketing.thedigitalmorph.com/0c5c50f0-a39e-4fa3-b899-d0bfcb173648' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src 'self' data: https:"`

## Root Cause

The Content Security Policy (CSP) in `middleware.ts` was blocking `blob:` URLs, which are commonly used for:
- **File uploads** - When users select images for profile pictures
- **Image previews** - Showing selected images before upload
- **Generated content** - Images created from canvas or file inputs

## Solution Applied âœ…

### Updated CSP Policy
**Before**: `img-src 'self' data: https:`
**After**: `img-src 'self' data: https: blob:`

### What This Enables
- âœ… **Profile picture uploads** - Users can upload and preview images
- âœ… **File input previews** - See selected images before upload
- âœ… **Canvas-generated images** - Any blob URLs created in the browser
- âœ… **Image processing** - Client-side image manipulation

## Security Considerations

### âœ… **Safe to Allow**
- `blob:` URLs are **same-origin** by default
- They're **temporary** and **ephemeral**
- They **cannot** load external content
- They're **sandboxed** to the current page

### ðŸ”’ **Security Benefits Maintained**
- Still blocks external image sources
- Still requires HTTPS for external images
- Still prevents data URI abuse
- Still maintains same-origin policy

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **User selects profile picture** â†’ File input creates blob URL
2. **Image preview shows** â†’ No CSP violation
3. **Upload proceeds** â†’ Image uploads successfully
4. **No more errors** â†’ Clean console logs

## Status: FIXED âœ…

The CSP policy now allows blob URLs for images, enabling:
- Profile picture uploads in onboarding
- Image previews in forms
- Client-side image processing
- File upload functionality

The onboarding page should now work perfectly with image uploads! ðŸš€
