# Check Existing Account Guide

## How to Verify if an Account Exists

### **Method 1: Try Signing In**
1. Go to `/auth/sign-in`
2. Enter your email and a password
3. If account exists, you'll either:
   - Sign in successfully (if password is correct)
   - Get "Invalid credentials" (if password is wrong)

### **Method 2: Use Forgot Password**
1. Go to `/auth/forgot-password`
2. Enter your email address
3. If account exists, you'll receive a password reset email
4. If no email is received, the account doesn't exist

### **Method 3: Check Database (Admin)**
If you have admin access, you can check:
```sql
-- Check if user exists in profiles
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Check if user exists in auth.users
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
