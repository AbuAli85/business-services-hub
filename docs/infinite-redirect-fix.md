# Infinite Redirect Loop Fix

## Issue Identified ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The onboarding page was stuck in an infinite redirect loop, causing the "Loading..." state and preventing proper navigation.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` was running multiple times, and each time it detected the user's `verification_status: "pending"`, it would try to redirect to `/auth/pending-approval`, but the redirect wasn't completing, causing the component to re-render and try again.

## Debug Logs Analysis

From the console logs, we could see:
```
üîç No role in URL, using role from profile: provider
‚è≥ Profile pending approval, redirecting to pending approval page
üîç Onboarding Debug: (repeated multiple times)
```

This showed the infinite loop pattern.

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Added Redirect State Management
```typescript
const [isRedirecting, setIsRedirecting] = useState(false)
const hasProcessedRedirect = useRef(false)
```

### 2. Prevented Multiple Redirects
```typescript
if (profile?.verification_status === 'pending') {
  if (!hasProcessedRedirect.current) {
    console.log('‚è≥ Profile pending approval, redirecting to pending approval page')
    hasProcessedRedirect.current = true
    setIsRedirecting(true)
    router.push('/auth/pending-approval')
    return
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Proper Loading State
```typescript
if (isRedirecting) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100 flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <Loader2 className="h-8 w-8 animate-spin mx-auto mb-4 text-blue-600" />
        <p className="text-gray-600">Redirecting...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 4. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
Removed `isRedirecting` from the dependency array to prevent the useEffect from running again after setting the redirect state.

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **User accesses onboarding page** ‚Üí Component loads
2. **useEffect runs once** ‚Üí Detects `verification_status: "pending"`
3. **Sets redirect state** ‚Üí `hasProcessedRedirect.current = true`
4. **Shows "Redirecting..."** ‚Üí User sees loading state
5. **Redirects to pending approval** ‚Üí `/auth/pending-approval`
6. **No more loops** ‚Üí Component doesn't re-render infinitely

## Status: FIXED ‚úÖ

The infinite redirect loop has been resolved. Users with `verification_status: "pending"` will now be properly redirected to the pending approval page without getting stuck in a loading loop.

### Key Benefits
1. **No more infinite loops** - Redirect happens only once
2. **Better UX** - User sees "Redirecting..." instead of "Loading..."
3. **Proper navigation** - Users reach the correct page
4. **Performance** - No unnecessary re-renders
5. **Debug visibility** - Clear console logs show the process

The onboarding page is now ready and will properly handle role-specific functionality for users who need to complete their profiles.
