# Signup Flow Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the signup/registration process to ensure it's fully functional and ready for production.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Signup Flow
**Test Case**: Complete signup with valid data
1. Navigate to `/auth/sign-up`
2. Select role (Client or Provider)
3. Fill in all required fields:
   - Full Name: "John Doe"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Phone: "+1234567890"
   - Company Name: "Test Company"
   - Password: "SecurePass123!"
   - Confirm Password: "SecurePass123!"
4. Complete captcha verification
5. Click "Create Account"

**Expected Result**: 
- Account created successfully
- Email verification modal appears (if email confirmation required)
- Success toast message displayed
- Redirect to onboarding page

### 2. Form Validation Tests

#### Email Validation
- **Invalid email**: "invalid-email" → Error: "Please enter a valid email address"
- **Empty email**: "" → Error: "Email is required"
- **Common typo**: "test@gmial.com" → Error: "Did you mean test@gmail.com?"

#### Password Validation
- **Weak password**: "123" → Error: "Password does not meet security requirements"
- **Common password**: "password" → Error: "This password is too common"
- **Mismatched passwords**: "Pass123!" vs "Pass123" → Error: "Passwords do not match"

#### Phone Validation
- **Invalid phone**: "123" → Error: "Please enter a valid phone number"
- **Empty phone**: "" → Error: "Phone number is required"
- **Fake number**: "1111111111" → Error: "Please enter a valid phone number"

#### Name Validation
- **Empty name**: "" → Error: "Full name is required"
- **Single name**: "John" → Error: "Please enter your full name (first and last name)"
- **Invalid characters**: "John123" → Error: "Full name can only contain letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes"

#### Company Validation
- **Empty company**: "" → Error: "Company name is required"
- **Invalid characters**: "Company@#$" → Error: "Company name contains invalid characters"

### 3. Error Handling Tests

#### Network Errors
- Disconnect internet during signup
- **Expected**: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."

#### Rate Limiting
- Attempt multiple rapid signups
- **Expected**: "Too many signup attempts. Please wait a moment before trying again."

#### Captcha Errors
- Submit without completing captcha
- **Expected**: "Please complete the captcha verification"

#### Duplicate Email
- Sign up with existing email
- **Expected**: "An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead."

### 4. UI/UX Tests

#### Loading States
- Form should show loading spinner during submission
- Submit button should be disabled during processing
- Form fields should be disabled during submission

#### Error Display
- Field-specific errors should appear below each input
- Error borders should appear on invalid fields
- Errors should clear when user starts typing

#### Password Strength Indicator
- Visual progress bar should update as user types
- Color should change based on strength (red → orange → yellow → blue → green)
- Requirements checklist should show real-time validation

#### Responsive Design
- Test on mobile devices (320px width)
- Test on tablet devices (768px width)
- Test on desktop (1024px+ width)

### 5. Integration Tests

#### Email Verification Flow
1. Complete signup with unverified email
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click verification link
4. **Expected**: Redirect to onboarding page

#### Onboarding Integration

2. **Expected**: Direct redirect to onboarding page
3. Verify role parameter is passed correctly

#### Session Management
1. Complete signup
2. Check that session is properly established

- **Expected**: Form submission fails without valid captcha

#### Input Sanitization
- Test with various special characters
- **Expected**: Input should be properly sanitized

### 7. Performance Tests
