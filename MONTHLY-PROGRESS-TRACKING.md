CREATE TABLE booking_progress (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    milestone_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    steps JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    progress INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (progress >= 0 AND progress <= 100),
    week_number INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (week_number >= 1 AND week_number <= 52),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()

const customMilestones = [
  {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    milestone_name: 'Custom Week 1: Discovery',
    steps: [
      { name: 'Client Interview', status: 'pending', tag: 'discovery' },
      { name: 'Requirements Analysis', status: 'pending', tag: 'analysis' }
    ],
    progress: 0,
    week_number: 1
  }
]
```

### Modifying Step Statuses
```typescript
// Available statuses
type StepStatus = 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'delayed'

// Update step status
const updatedStep = {
  name: 'Step Name',
  status: 'completed',
  tag: 'optional-tag'
}
```

## 📈 Progress Calculation

### Milestone Progress
- Calculated as: `(completed_steps / total_steps) * 100`
- Automatically updated when step status changes
- Rounded to nearest integer

### Overall Progress
- Calculated as: `average(milestone_progress)`
- Updated in real-time
- Displayed in progress bar and summary

## 🚨 Overdue Detection

### Automatic Detection
- Milestones are marked overdue if:
  - `week_number < current_week`
  - `progress < 100`
- Visual indicators: Red badges and borders
- Automatic flagging in progress summary

### Manual Override
- Providers can manually mark steps as "delayed"
- Delayed steps are visually distinct
- Overdue status is recalculated automatically

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view progress for their own bookings
- Providers have full CRUD access
- Clients have read-only access

### API Authentication
- JWT token validation
- Role-based endpoint access
- CORS headers for cross-domain requests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No Progress Tracking Set Up"
- **Cause**: Milestones haven't been created yet
- **Solution**: Click "Create Monthly Milestones" button

#### "Failed to create milestones"
- **Cause**: Database migration not applied
- **Solution**: Run the migration script in Supabase

#### "Access denied" errors
- **Cause**: User doesn't have permission
- **Solution**: Ensure user is client or provider for the booking

#### Progress not updating
- **Cause**: API call failed or step status not saved
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors, refresh page

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'monthly-progress')
```
