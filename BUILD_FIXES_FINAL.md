# Build Fixes - Final Resolution

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🔴 Build Error #2

**Error**: `./components/dashboard/backend-driven-milestones.tsx:26:36`  
**Message**: Cannot find module '@/hooks/use-backend-progress'

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The file `backend-driven-milestones.tsx` was importing the deleted `use-backend-progress` hook.

**Investigation**:
- Checked if component is used anywhere: ❌ NOT USED
- Searched for imports: ❌ NO IMPORTS FOUND
- Conclusion: Legacy unused component

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Deleted the unused component entirely**

**File Removed**: `components/dashboard/backend-driven-milestones.tsx`

**Reason**: 
- Not imported anywhere in the codebase
- Depends on deleted hook (`use-backend-progress`)
- Legacy component from previous implementation
- No functionality loss (nothing uses it)

---
