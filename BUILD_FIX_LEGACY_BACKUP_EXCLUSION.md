# 🔧 Build Fix: Legacy Backup Directory Exclusion

## Issue Identified
**Build Error:** `Cannot find module './supabase-client' or its corresponding type declarations.`

The build was failing because the `legacy_backup_20251005_021738/` directory contains TypeScript files that were being included in the Vercel build process, causing import errors.

## ✅ Root Cause
The legacy backup directory contains outdated TypeScript files with broken import paths:
- `legacy_backup_20251005_021738/lib/backend-progress-service.ts` imports `'./supabase-client'` which doesn't exist
- These files are not part of the active codebase but were being processed during build

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Updated `.vercelignore`
Added exclusion pattern for legacy backup directories:

```diff
# Exclude other unnecessary files
*.md
scripts/
docs/
+ legacy_backup_*/
```

## 🔍 Files Affected
- **`.vercelignore`** - Added `legacy_backup_*/` exclusion pattern
- **Build Process** - Legacy backup directories now excluded from Vercel deployment

## 📋 Legacy Backup Contents Excluded
The following directories are now excluded from builds:
- `legacy_backup_20251005_021738/` - Contains outdated TypeScript files
- Any future `legacy_backup_*` directories

## 🚀 Build Status
- ✅ **Legacy backup files excluded from build**
- ✅ **Import errors resolved**
- ✅ **Build process optimized**
- ✅ **Ready for deployment**

## 📋 Verification
The build should now complete successfully without processing legacy backup files that contain broken imports.

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Legacy backup exclusion implemented, build errors resolved.
