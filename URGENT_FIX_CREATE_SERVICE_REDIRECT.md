# URGENT: Create Service Redirect Fix

## Quick Diagnostic

I've created a debug page to check your user role. This will tell us exactly why you're being redirected.

### Step 1: Check Your Role

1. Navigate to: **`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/debug-role`** (or your domain + `/dashboard/debug-role`)
2. Look at the output, specifically:
   - **Profile Role**: Should say `"provider"`
   - **Metadata Role**: Should say `"provider"`

### Step 2: Interpret Results

**If Profile Role shows "client" or something other than "provider":**
- ‚úÖ **This is the problem!** Your account role is not set to "provider"
- The RoleGuard is correctly blocking access because you're not a provider
- **Solution**: We need to update your role in the database

**If Profile Role shows "provider":**
- The RoleGuard should be letting you through
- There might be a caching or timing issue
- Check browser console logs for detailed RoleGuard messages

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option A: If Your Role is Wrong

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com' with your actual email
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'provider' 
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Also update user metadata
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "provider"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';
```

Then:
1. Sign out
2. Sign back in
3. Try accessing Create Service again

### Option B: Bypass RoleGuard Temporarily

If you need immediate access while we debug, I can modify the provider layout to temporarily disable the RoleGuard:

```typescript
// In app/dashboard/provider/layout.tsx
export default function ProviderLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <>{children}</> // Temporary bypass
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This bypasses security, only use for testing!

## What I've Already Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Added role caching to prevent repeated auth checks
2. ‚úÖ Removed 2-second artificial delay from Create Service page
3. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging to track redirect flow
4. ‚úÖ Created debug page to check role

## Next Steps

1. Go to the debug page: `/dashboard/debug-role`
2. Copy the output (there's a button)
3. Share it with me so I can see exactly what's happening
4. Based on the results, I'll provide the exact fix

## Browser Console Logs

Also, please check your browser console (F12) when you click "New Service". Look for these logs:

```
üöÄ New Service button clicked - redirecting to create service page
üõ°Ô∏è RoleGuard checking access
üîç RoleGuard: Checking metadata role
```

If you see:
- ‚ùå `RoleGuard: Access denied` - Your role doesn't match
- ‚è∞ `RoleGuard timeout` - Auth check is taking too long

Share these logs with me!
