-- Fix v_booking_status view to include ALL missing columns for invoice generation
-- This resolves multiple column errors like:
-- - "column v_booking_status.service_description does not exist"
-- - "column v_booking_status.client_company does not exist"

-- Drop and recreate v_booking_status view with ALL required columns
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_booking_status CASCADE;

-- Create the v_booking_status view with ALL columns needed for invoice generation
