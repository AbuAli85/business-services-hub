-- Fix client company information in v_booking_status view
-- This addresses the issue where client_company shows as null

-- First, let's check the current profiles table structure
-- and see how company information is stored

-- Option 1: If profiles has a company_name text field
-- Option 2: If profiles has a company_id foreign key
-- Option 3: If we need to create a fallback

-- Drop and recreate v_booking_status view with improved client company handling
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_booking_status CASCADE;

-- Create the v_booking_status view with better client company handling
