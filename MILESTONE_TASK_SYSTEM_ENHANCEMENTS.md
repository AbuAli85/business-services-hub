This update is **fully backward compatible**. Existing milestones and tasks will work without any changes. The component now provides a much richer interface while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Milestone won't delete**
A: Ensure you have provider or admin role and confirm the deletion dialog.

**Q: Progress not updating**
A: Click "Refresh Progress" button or check if tasks have the correct status.

**Q: Can't see edit buttons**
A: Edit/delete buttons are only visible to providers and admins, not clients.

## Summary

This enhancement transforms the milestone system from a read-only display into a fully functional project management tool. Users can now create, edit, and organize milestones and tasks directly from the UI, with automatic progress tracking and role-based permissions. The interface is intuitive, responsive, and provides immediate feedback for all actions.
