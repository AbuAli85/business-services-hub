# Bookings Page Fixes - Summary

## Date: 2025-01-05

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Total Revenue Showing OMR 0.00 ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: 
The revenue calculation in `lib/booking-utils.ts` was only counting invoices with status `'issued'` or `'paid'`, excluding `'draft'` invoices. This caused the total revenue to show as 0.00 even when bookings had amounts.

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Only counted 'issued' and 'paid' invoices
const totalRevenue = invoices
  .filter(inv => ['issued', 'paid'].includes(inv.status))
  .reduce((sum, inv) => sum + (inv.amount || 0), 0)
```

**Solution**:
Updated the revenue calculation to include all non-void invoices (draft, issued, and paid):

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Counts all non-void invoices
const totalRevenue = invoices
  .filter(inv => inv.status !== 'void')
  .reduce((sum, inv) => {
    const amount = inv.amount || inv.total_amount || 0
    console.log('üìä Invoice for revenue:', { 
      id: inv.id, 
      booking_id: inv.booking_id, 
      status: inv.status, 
      amount 
    })
    return sum + amount
  }, 0)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/booking-utils.ts` (lines 68-87)

---

### 2. Missing Invoice Data Debugging üîç ‚Üí ‚úÖ ADDED

**Problem**: 
No visibility into whether invoices were being fetched correctly from the API.

**Solution**:
Added comprehensive console logging in `hooks/useBookings.ts` to track:
- Invoice fetch requests
- Number of invoices loaded
- Invoice status breakdown
- Total amount from all invoices

**Example Output**:
```
üì• Fetching invoices from /api/invoices...
‚úÖ Invoices loaded: {
  count: 15,
  statuses: { draft: 5, issued: 8, paid: 2 },
  totalAmount: 2850.00
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `hooks/useBookings.ts` (lines 211-246)

---

### 3. Stats Calculation Visibility üìä ‚Üí ‚úÖ IMPROVED

**Problem**:
No visibility into how booking statistics were being calculated, making it hard to debug issues like incorrect revenue or completion rates.

**Solution**:
Added detailed logging in `app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx` to show:
- Number of bookings and invoices being processed
- Whether summary stats are available
- Final calculated statistics including revenue

**Example Output**:
```
üìä Calculating stats with: {
  bookingsCount: 20,
  invoicesCount: 15,
  hasSummaryStats: false
}
üìä Calculated stats: {
  total: 20,
  completed: 1,
  inProgress: 4,
  pending: 1,
  approved: 19,
  totalRevenue: 2850.00,
  projectedBillings: 1240.00,
  avgCompletionTime: 7.2,
  pendingApproval: 1,
  readyToLaunch: 0
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx` (lines 176-204)

---

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. **Open Browser Dev Tools Console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to** `https://marketing.thedigitalmorph.com/dashboard/bookings`
3. **Check Console Logs** for:
   - Invoice fetching status
   - Revenue calculation details
   - Stats calculation output

4. **Verify UI Display**:
   - Total Revenue should now show the correct sum of all non-void invoices
   - Completion Rate should reflect actual completed vs total bookings
   - All stats should be populated correctly

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Revenue Display:
- ‚úÖ Shows sum of all draft, issued, and paid invoices
- ‚úÖ Excludes only void invoices
- ‚úÖ Handles both `amount` and `total_amount` fields
- ‚úÖ Displays in OMR currency format

### Console Output:
- ‚úÖ Clear logging of invoice fetching process
- ‚úÖ Detailed breakdown of invoice statuses
- ‚úÖ Individual invoice amounts logged for revenue calculation
- ‚úÖ Final stats calculation logged for verification

### Data Flow:
1. Bookings fetched from `/api/bookings`
2. Invoices fetched separately from `/api/invoices`
3. Stats calculated using `calculateBookingStats()`
4. Revenue computed from all non-void invoices
5. UI updated with correct values

---

## Additional Notes

### Completion Rate
The completion rate showing 5% is **ACCURATE** if only 1 out of 20 bookings is completed:
- Formula: `(completed / total) * 100`
- Example: `(1 / 20) * 100 = 5%`

This is displayed in the `BookingSummaryStats` component and is working correctly.

### Invoice Status Handling
- `draft`: Counted in revenue (represents pending invoices)
- `issued`: Counted in revenue (invoices sent to clients)
- `paid`: Counted in revenue (completed payments)
- `void`: **NOT** counted in revenue (cancelled invoices)
