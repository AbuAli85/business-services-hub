## 🔧 Monitoring Setup

### 1. Email Delivery Monitoring

**Resend Dashboard:**
```
https://resend.com/emails
→ Check delivery rate
→ Review bounce/complaint rates
→ Monitor API usage
```

**SendGrid Dashboard:**
```
https://app.sendgrid.com/stats
→ Delivery statistics
→ Bounce/spam reports
→ API key usage
```

### 2. Supabase Realtime Health

**Check Subscription:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM realtime.messages 
WHERE inserted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY inserted_at DESC;
```

**Monitor Channels:**
```javascript
// In browser console on provider dashboard
console.log('Realtime channels:', 
  window.supabaseClient?.realtime?.channels
)
```

### 3. Application Logging

**Add Monitoring Service (Recommended):**

**Option A: Sentry**
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

**Option B: Logtail**
```bash
npm install @logtail/node @logtail/next
```

**Option C: LogRocket**
```bash
npm install logrocket logrocket-react
```

### 4. Custom Monitoring Endpoint

Create `app/api/admin/health/notifications/route.ts`:
```typescript
export async function GET() {
  const stats = {
    audit_logs_count: await getAuditLogCount(),
    notifications_count: await getNotificationCount(),
    email_queue_size: await getEmailQueueSize(),
    realtime_status: await checkRealtimeHealth()
  }
  
  return Response.json(stats)
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Check:**
1. Environment variables set?
   ```bash
   echo $RESEND_API_KEY
   ```
2. API key valid?
   - Test in Resend/SendGrid dashboard
3. From address verified?
   - Check domain verification
4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   vercel logs --since 1h
   ```

**Solution:**
- Verify API key in Vercel dashboard
- Check email provider status page
- Review console logs for specific error

### Issue: Notifications Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Supabase Realtime enabled?
2. Notification inserted in database?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications 
   WHERE user_id = 'provider-id'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
3. Browser console for subscription errors?

**Solution:**
- Restart Supabase Realtime
- Check RLS policies
- Verify user_id matches

### Issue: Audit Logs Empty

**Check:**
1. Table exists?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM service_audit_logs LIMIT 1;
   ```
2. Admin actor info loaded?
   - Check console for actorId, actorName

**Solution:**
- Run missing migrations
- Check admin profile data
- Verify function calls
