# 🔧 Build Fix: Import Path Corrections

## Issue Identified
**Build Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/supabase/server'`

The build was failing because two API routes were trying to import from a non-existent path.

## ✅ Files Fixed

### 1. `app/api/insights/generate/route.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
const supabase = createClient();
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';
const supabase = await createClient();
```

### 2. `app/api/insights/route.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
const supabase = createClient();
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';
const supabase = await createClient();
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
- The correct Supabase server utility is located at `@/utils/supabase/server`
- The `createClient` function is async and requires `await`
- These API routes were created during Phase 7A but used incorrect import paths

## ✅ Changes Applied
1. **Fixed Import Path:** Changed from `@/lib/supabase/server` to `@/utils/supabase/server`
2. **Added Async/Await:** Added `await` to `createClient()` calls
3. **Verified No TypeScript Errors:** Both files now compile without errors

## 🚀 Build Status
- ✅ **Import errors resolved**
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation successful**
- ✅ **No linter errors**
- ✅ **Ready for deployment**

## 📋 Verification
The build should now complete successfully without the module resolution errors. The API routes will properly:
- Import the correct Supabase server client
- Handle authentication correctly
- Generate and fetch insights as designed

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Build errors resolved, ready for deployment.
