## 🔧 Improvements Made

### 1. ✅ **Price Field Clarity & Toggle Behavior**

**Before:**
- Price field always showed "OMR0.00" 
- Toggles didn't clearly affect the input field
- No tooltips explaining toggle behavior

**After:**
- **Smart Input Behavior**: When "Custom quotation" is selected:
  - Input field becomes disabled with grayed-out styling
  - Placeholder changes to "Contact for quote"
  - Clear visual indication that price input is not needed
- **Enhanced Tooltips**: Added helpful tooltips for both toggles:
  - "Starting from": "Price shown as 'Starting from' to indicate minimum cost"
  - "Custom quotation": "Client will contact you for a personalized quote"
- **Better Spacing**: Increased spacing between toggle options for clarity

### 2. ✅ **Description Field Hints & Character Counter**

**Before:**
- "Minimum 50 characters" was separate from character counter
- Static character counter without visual feedback
- Basic placeholder text

**After:**
- **Integrated Placeholder**: "(Minimum 50 characters)" added to placeholder text
- **Smart Character Counter**: 
  - Shows "✓ Minimum requirement met" when ≥50 characters (green)
  - Shows "Need X more characters" when <50 characters (amber)
  - Color-coded feedback for better UX
- **Enhanced Counter**: "X/500 characters" format for clarity
- **Max Length**: Added `maxLength={500}` attribute for browser validation

### 3. ✅ **Visual Spacing & Form Organization**

**Before:**
- Dense form sections with minimal spacing
- Inconsistent spacing between elements

**After:**
- **Better Section Spacing**: Added `space-y-2` and `space-y-3` classes
- **Improved Price Section**: Enhanced spacing around price input and toggles
- **Consistent Layout**: Better visual hierarchy throughout the form

### 4. ✅ **Cover Image Preview** 

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented
- Cover image preview functionality was already working correctly
- Shows image preview when file is selected
- Proper placeholder when no image is chosen

## 📊 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- **`app/dashboard/provider/create-service/page.tsx`** - Main improvements

### Key Changes:
1. **Price Input Logic** (Lines 808-825):
   ```typescript
   value={formData.price_type === 'custom_quotation' ? '' : formData.price}
   placeholder={formData.price_type === 'custom_quotation' ? 'Contact for quote' : '0.00'}
   disabled={formData.price_type === 'custom_quotation'}
   ```

2. **Enhanced Tooltips** (Lines 840-861):
   ```typescript
   <Tooltip content="Price shown as 'Starting from' to indicate minimum cost">
     <HelpCircle className="h-3 w-3 text-slate-400" />
   </Tooltip>
   ```

3. **Smart Character Counter** (Lines 896-902):
   ```typescript
   {formData.description.length >= 50 ? '✓ Minimum requirement met' : `Need ${50 - formData.description.length} more characters`}
   ```

4. **Better Spacing** (Lines 792, 872):
   ```typescript
   <div className="space-y-3">  // Price section
   <div className="space-y-2">  // Description section
   ```
