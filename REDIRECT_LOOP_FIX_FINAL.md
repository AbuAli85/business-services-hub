# Redirect Loop Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Identified

The console logs showed an **infinite redirect loop** between `/dashboard` (main) and `/dashboard/client`:

```
page-363bf6a7936c1691.js: 🔐 Checking authentication...
page-363bf6a7936c1691.js: ✅ User authenticated: chairman@falconeyegroup.net | Role: client
page-363bf6a7936c1691.js: 🔄 Redirecting client to their dashboard
page-5d26a05fd715f1a3.js: 🔐 Checking authentication...
page-5d26a05fd715f1a3.js: ✅ User authenticated: chairman@falconeyegroup.net | Role: client
page-5d26a05fd715f1a3.js: 👤 Client user confirmed, loading data...
[REPEATING INFINITELY]
```

### Root Cause

The main dashboard's `useEffect` was running **multiple times** due to:
1. Next.js re-rendering during navigation
2. The `useEffect` running on every render when dependencies changed
3. Both pages mounting simultaneously during transition

## Solution Applied

### Added `hasCheckedAuth` Ref Guard

**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Added ref to prevent multiple auth checks
const hasCheckedAuth = useRef(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (pathname !== '/dashboard') return
  if (hasCheckedAuth.current) return  // ✅ Only run once
  
  hasCheckedAuth.current = true  // Mark as checked
  let isMounted = true
  const controller = new AbortController()

  const init = async () => {
    // ... auth logic
  }

  init()

  return () => {
    isMounted = false
    controller.abort()
    hasCheckedAuth.current = false  // ✅ Reset for next mount
  }
}, [pathname])
```

### How It Works

1. **First Mount**: `hasCheckedAuth.current` is `false` → auth check runs
2. **Subsequent Re-renders**: `hasCheckedAuth.current` is `true` → auth check skipped
3. **Cleanup**: Reset `hasCheckedAuth.current` to `false` for next mount on this route
4. **Route Change**: When `pathname` changes, cleanup runs and resets the flag

## Result

✅ **Auth check runs exactly once** per mount on `/dashboard`  
✅ **No more redirect loops**  
✅ **Clean navigation** to role-specific dashboards  
✅ **Fast redirects** without repeated auth checks

## Testing

Verified that:
- Client users: `/dashboard` → redirects once to `/dashboard/client` → stays there
- Provider users: `/dashboard` → redirects once to `/dashboard/provider` → stays there
- Admin users: `/dashboard` → stays there (no redirect)
- No infinite loops in console logs

## Files Modified

1. **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** (Main Dashboard)
   - Added `hasCheckedAuth` ref
   - Added guard in useEffect to prevent multiple runs
   - Reset flag in cleanup

2. **`app/dashboard/client/page.tsx`** (Client Dashboard)
   - Added `hasCheckedAuth` ref
   - Added `useRef` import
   - Added guard in useEffect to prevent multiple runs
   - Reset flag in cleanup

3. **`app/dashboard/provider/page.tsx`** (Provider Dashboard)
   - Added `hasCheckedAuth` ref
   - Added `useRef` import
   - Added guard in useEffect to prevent multiple runs
   - Reset flag in cleanup

## Why All Three Dashboards Need This Fix

The redirect loop occurs because during navigation:
1. User navigates to `/dashboard` 
2. Main dashboard mounts → checks auth → redirects to role-specific dashboard
3. Role-specific dashboard mounts
4. **Both pages re-render during transition** → both run auth checks again
5. This creates an infinite loop

By adding the `hasCheckedAuth` ref guard to **all three dashboards**, we ensure each dashboard's auth check runs **exactly once per mount**, preventing the loop.

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (All 3 Dashboards)  
**Impact**: Critical (eliminates infinite redirect loop)  
**Risk**: Minimal (simple ref guard)  
**Consistency**: 100% (same pattern across all dashboards)
