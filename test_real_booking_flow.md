# üß™ How to Test Your Notification System

## **Step 1: Database Verification** ‚úÖ
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of verify_notification_tables.sql
```

## **Step 2: Frontend Testing** 
1. **Open your application** in the browser
2. **Log in** as a user
3. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. **Run the frontend test**:
```javascript
// Copy and paste the contents of test_frontend_notifications.js
```

## **Step 3: Visual Verification**

### **üîî Check Notification Bell**
- Look for a bell icon in your header/navigation
- It should show a number (unread count) if you have notifications
- Click it to see a dropdown with recent notifications

### **üì± Check Notification Center**
- Navigate to `/dashboard/notifications`
- You should see a full notification management interface
- Try filtering, marking as read, etc.

### **üìß Check Email Notifications**
- Check your email inbox
- Look for notification emails with your branding
- Emails should have action buttons and professional styling

## **Step 4: Test Real Booking Flow**

### **Create a Test Booking:**
1. **Go to booking creation page** (`/dashboard/bookings/create`)
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Submit the booking**
4. **Watch for notifications**:
   - Notification bell should show new count
   - Both client and provider should get notifications
   - Check email inbox for notification emails

### **Test Different Events:**
- **Task completion** ‚Üí Should trigger milestone notifications
- **Payment processing** ‚Üí Should trigger payment notifications
- **Invoice creation** ‚Üí Should trigger invoice notifications

## **Step 5: Check User Preferences**

### **Notification Settings:**
1. **Go to notification settings** (`/dashboard/notifications` or settings page)
2. **Toggle different notification types** on/off
3. **Change email preferences** (template style, delivery timing)
4. **Test email verification** if available

## **Step 6: Monitor System**

### **Check Database:**
```sql
-- See all notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- See email logs
SELECT * FROM email_notification_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check notification statistics
SELECT 
  type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN read = false THEN 1 END) as unread
FROM notifications 
GROUP BY type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### **Check Console Logs:**
- Look for any error messages in browser console
- Check network tab for failed API calls
- Monitor Supabase logs for any issues

## **Step 7: Test Edge Cases**

### **Test Different Scenarios:**
- **User with no email** ‚Üí Should still create in-app notifications
- **Email delivery failure** ‚Üí Should log error but not break app
- **Large number of notifications** ‚Üí Should handle pagination
- **Different user roles** ‚Üí Should respect permissions
