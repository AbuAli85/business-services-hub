# ✅ Duplicate Create Service Pages - Fixed

## 🔍 Problem Identified

There were **two different Create Service pages** with different implementations:

### **Page 1: `/dashboard/provider/create-service`** ✅ (Modern)
- **4-step wizard** with stepper component
- **Aligned with bookings system** (milestones, requirements)
- **Modern UI** with tooltips and better UX
- **New data structure** (CreateServiceFormData)
- **Database integration** with service_requirements and service_milestones tables

### **Page 2: `/dashboard/services/create`** ❌ (Outdated)
- **4-step form** but different structure
- **Old data structure** (ServiceFormData)
- **Basic UI** without modern components
- **Different fields** (portfolio_url, contact_email, etc.)
- **No integration** with bookings system

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### ✅ **1. Consolidated Pages**
- **Kept the modern implementation** at `/dashboard/provider/create-service`
- **Replaced the old page** at `/dashboard/services/create` with a redirect
- **Unified user experience** across the application

### ✅ **2. Updated All Navigation Links**
Updated the following files to point to the unified page:
- `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/enhanced/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/provider/[id]/page.tsx`

### ✅ **3. Redirect Implementation**
The old `/dashboard/services/create` page now:
- **Automatically redirects** to `/dashboard/provider/create-service`
- **Shows loading spinner** during redirect
- **Maintains user experience** without breaking existing links

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

### **1. Single Source of Truth**
- Only one Create Service implementation
- Consistent data structure and validation
- Unified user experience

### **2. Modern Features**

- No breaking changes for users

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### **Core Changes:**
1. **`app/dashboard/services/create/page.tsx`** - Replaced with redirect
2. **`app/dashboard/provider/create-service/page.tsx`** - Kept as main implementation

### **Navigation Updates:**
