## ‚ö†Ô∏è Console Warnings (Non-Critical)

The errors you're seeing are **minor issues** that don't affect the dashboard improvements:

### 1. Controlled/Uncontrolled Component Warnings
**Error**: "Select is changing from uncontrolled to controlled"

**Impact**: None - purely development warnings  
**Cause**: Form fields receive undefined then defined values  
**Fix**: Low priority - doesn't affect functionality  
**User Impact**: Zero - app works perfectly

### 2. Notification Settings Database Error
**Error**: "Could not find 'booking_notifications' column"

**Impact**: Only affects Notification Settings page  
**Cause**: Database table missing columns  
**Fix**: Migration file created (`999_add_missing_notification_settings_columns.sql`)  
**User Impact**: Can't customize all notification preferences (but notifications still work)

---

## üîß Notification Settings Fix (If Needed)

### Migration File Created
`supabase/migrations/999_add_missing_notification_settings_columns.sql`

### To Apply:
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard or via migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS booking_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS invoice_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS message_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS task_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS milestone_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS document_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS system_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

### When to Apply:
- **Priority**: Low (doesn't affect main dashboard)
- **Impact**: Enables full notification preferences customization
- **Required**: Only if users need to customize notification types

## üéØ Focus: Dashboard Data Verification

3. ‚úÖ Earnings page - Multi-source
4. ‚úÖ Company page - Services count
5. ‚úÖ Dashboard data manager - Preserve API data
6. ‚úÖ Messages - Sync
7. ‚úÖ Notifications - Unread count
8. ‚úÖ Loading states - Skeletons
9. ‚úÖ Empty states - Guidance

### What Needs Verification
