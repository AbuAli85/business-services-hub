- Profile creation now handled automatically via database triggers

### 4. Debugging Tools ✅ ADDED

- Better console logging for troubleshooting

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Restart Your Development Server
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 2. Test the Signup
- Go to `/auth/sign-up`
- Try creating a new account
- Check the browser console for any errors
- The environment checker on the dashboard will show configuration status

### 3. For Production Deployment
If you're deploying to Vercel, Netlify, or another platform:

1. **Set Environment Variables** in your hosting platform:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

2. **Verify Supabase Settings**:
   - Check that your Supabase project is active
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Verify the project allows connections from your domain

## Testing

### Environment Checker
- Visit `/dashboard` to see the environment checker (development only)
- It will show you exactly what's configured and what's missing

### Test Page
- Visit `/test` to run connection tests
- Test both basic connectivity and signup endpoint
- Use this to debug any remaining issues

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Still Getting 500 Errors?
1. **Check .env.local file exists** and contains correct values
2. **Restart development server** after making changes
3. **Verify Supabase project** is active and accessible
4. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages

### Environment Variables Not Loading?
1. **File naming**: Must be exactly `.env.local` (not `.env`)
2. **Location**: Must be in project root directory
3. **Format**: No spaces around `=` sign
4. **Restart**: Server must be restarted after changes

### Supabase Connection Issues?
1. **Check URL**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is correct
2. **Check Key**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is valid
3. **Project Status**: Verify Supabase project is not paused
4. **Network**: Check if your network allows the connection

## Files Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Added favicon metadata
- `app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx` - Improved error handling
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Enhanced environment validation
- `components/env-checker.tsx` - Better debugging interface
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added environment checker
- `app/test/page.tsx` - New debugging page
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration file

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** with the fixes
2. **Deploy to production** with proper environment variables
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Use test page** to verify production deployment

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the test page at `/test`
2. Review browser console logs
3. Check the environment checker on dashboard
4. Verify your Supabase project settings

The fixes should resolve both the favicon 404 error and the Supabase 500 error. The signup process should now work properly both locally and in production.
