# Business Services Hub - Dashboard Issues & Fixes

## Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### 1. Data Synchronization Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** Dashboard shows OMR 6,400 and 20 bookings, but My Services shows 0 bookings and OMR 0 revenue.

**Root Cause:** Services API doesn't return booking counts and revenue per service. The `calculateServiceBookingCounts()` method in `dashboard-data.ts` calculates counts client-side, but this data isn't being used consistently across pages.

**Fix Required:**
- Modify `/api/services` endpoint to include `booking_count` and `total_revenue` for each service
- Add aggregation query to count bookings per service_id
- Update service mapping to include these fields
- Ensure consistency across all dashboard pages

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/api/services/route.ts` - Add booking count aggregation
- `lib/dashboard-data.ts` - Ensure calculated counts are used
- `app/dashboard/services/page.tsx` - Use updated service data

### 2. Bookings Page Initial Load Shows Zeros ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** First page load shows 0 total bookings and 0 revenue. After navigating to page 2 and back, metrics display correctly.

**Root Cause:** Metrics calculation depends on async data that hasn't loaded yet on initial render.

**Fix Required:**
- Add loading state for metrics
- Show skeleton loaders instead of zeros
- Calculate metrics only after data is fully loaded
- Add proper dependency tracking in useEffect

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx` - Add loading states
- `hooks/useBookings.ts` - Improve data loading logic

### 3. Earnings Page Shows All Zeros Despite Having Data ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Problem:** All earnings cards show 0 despite invoices existing with amounts.

**Root Cause:** Earnings calculations aren't pulling from invoice/booking data correctly.

**Fix Required:**
- Update earnings calculations to aggregate from invoices and bookings
- Ensure invoice amounts are properly summed
- Add earnings trend data for charts

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/provider/earnings/page.tsx` - Fix earnings calculations
- Create earnings API endpoint if needed

### 4. Company Page Shows 0 Services Despite Having 9 ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Problem:** Company stats show 0 services when 9 services exist.

**Root Cause:** Company stats aren't fetching service count for the provider.

**Fix Required:**
- Add service count to company stats API
- Query services table filtered by provider_id
- Display correct service count

**Files to Modify:**
- Company page component (need to identify)
- Company stats API (need to identify)

## Medium Priority Issues (Priority 2)

### 5. Messages: Conversation Preview vs Chat Window Sync üî∏ **MEDIUM**
**Problem:** Conversation preview shows message, but chat window says "No messages yet" until clicked again.

**Fix Required:**
- Ensure message list refreshes when conversation is selected
- Add proper state management for active conversation
- Force reload of messages on conversation change

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx` or message component
- Message hook or state management

### 6. Notifications: Unread Count Shows 0 üî∏ **MEDIUM**
**Problem:** Unread counter shows 0 despite unread notifications existing.

**Fix Required:**
- Calculate unread count from notifications array
- Update count when notifications are marked as read
- Add proper filtering for unread status

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`
- Notifications API or state management

## Low Priority Improvements (Priority 3)

### 7. Loading States Instead of Zeros üîπ **LOW**
**Problem:** Many metrics show 0 while data loads, causing confusion.

**Fix Required:**
- Add skeleton loaders for all metric cards
- Show "loading..." state instead of 0
- Add spinners for async operations

**Apply to:**
- All dashboard pages
- All metric cards
- All data tables

### 8. Empty State Guidance üîπ **LOW**
**Problem:** Empty sections (skills, education, etc.) show nothing, no guidance for users.

**Fix Required:**
- Add "Add your first skill" prompts
- Add "You haven't earned revenue yet" messages
- Add action buttons for empty states

**Apply to:**
- Profile page (skills, education, links)
- Earnings page (if no earnings)
- Services page (if no services)

### 9. Top Performing Services Shows Zero Data üîπ **LOW**
**Problem:** "Top Performing Services" section shows services with 0 bookings.

**Fix Required:**
- Hide section if no bookings exist
- Show message: "No bookings yet - start promoting your services!"
- Sort by actual booking count when data exists

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/dashboard/provider/page.tsx` or services page
