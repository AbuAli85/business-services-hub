## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Download Button Made Functional**
**Before:**
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => toast.success('Downloading invoice...')}>
  <Download />
</Button>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => {
  // Generate real CSV file
  const csvData = [
    ['Invoice ID', invoice.id],
    ['Client', invoice.clientName],
    ['Provider', invoice.providerName],
    ['Service', invoice.serviceTitle],
    ['Amount', `${invoice.currency} ${invoice.amount}`],
    ['Status', invoice.status],
    ['Issued', new Date(invoice.issuedAt).toLocaleDateString()],
    ['Due', new Date(invoice.dueAt).toLocaleDateString()]
  ]
  
  const csv = csvData.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n')
  const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: 'text/csv' })
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  const a = document.createElement('a')
  a.href = url
  a.download = `invoice-${invoice.id}-${Date.now()}.csv`
  a.click()
  
  toast.success('Invoice downloaded')
}}>
  <Download />
</Button>
```

### 2. **Real-Time Subscription**
```typescript
const { isConnected: realtimeConnected, lastUpdate } = useInvoicesRealtime((update) => {
  setHasRecentUpdate(true)
  refresh() // Auto-refresh data
  
  // Smart notifications
  if (update.event === 'INSERT') {
    toast.success('New invoice created')
  } else if (update.event === 'UPDATE' && update.record?.status === 'paid') {
    toast.success('Invoice marked as paid')
  }
})
```

### 3. **Modern UI Header**
```tsx
<div className={`bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-indigo-600 
                 rounded-xl p-8 text-white transition-all duration-300 
                 ${hasRecentUpdate ? 'ring-4 ring-yellow-400' : ''}`}>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">
    <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Invoice Management</h1>
    {realtimeConnected && (
      <Badge className="bg-green-500/20 text-white border-white/30">
        <Radio className="h-3 w-3 mr-1 animate-pulse" />
        Live
      </Badge>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
```
