# Debug Instructions: Create Service Redirect Issue

## Problem
When clicking "New Service" button, the user is being redirected to the dashboard instead of reaching the Create Service page.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console Logs

Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab. You should see logs like:

```
üöÄ New Service button clicked - redirecting to create service page
üõ°Ô∏è RoleGuard checking access {allow: ['provider', 'admin'], cachedRole: ..., initialOk: ...}
üé® CreateServicePage component mounted
```

Look for these specific log messages:
- ‚úÖ `RoleGuard: Using cached role` - Cache is working
- üîç `RoleGuard: Checking metadata role` - Checking user metadata
- üîç `RoleGuard: Checked profile role` - Checking profile database
- ‚úÖ `RoleGuard: Metadata/Profile role allowed` - Access granted
- ‚ùå `RoleGuard: Access denied, redirecting to` - **ACCESS DENIED** (this is the problem!)

### 2. What to Look For

**If you see "Access denied":**
- Check what `role` value it shows (should be 'provider')
- Check what `allow` array shows (should be ['provider', 'admin'])
- If role doesn't match allow array, that's the issue

**If you don't see CreateServicePage mounted:**
- The RoleGuard is blocking before the page even loads
- Check if there's a timeout message (‚è∞)

**If you see the page mount then redirect:**
- There might be redirect logic in the CreateServicePage component itself

### 3. Common Issues

1. **User role is not 'provider'**
   - Your account might be set as 'client' or another role
   - Check: Look at the console log for "RoleGuard: Checked profile role"

2. **Session expired**
   - You might need to sign out and sign back in
   - Look for auth errors in console

3. **Cache not working**
   - First navigation should work but subsequent ones don't
   - Look for "Using cached role" message on second click

## Next Steps

Please:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "New Service" button
3. Copy ALL console logs
4. Share them so I can see exactly what's happening

## Temporary Workaround

If you need immediate access, try:
1. Navigate directly to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/provider/create-service`
2. Or try clearing browser cache and signing in again
