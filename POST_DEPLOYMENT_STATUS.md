## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
**Important:** Before testing, do a hard refresh:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Or**: Open DevTools → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 2. Open Console (F12)

### 3. Test Each Page

#### My Services Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/services`

**Look for these console logs:**
```
📊 Sample service being returned: {booking_count: 3, total_revenue: 240}
📊 Dashboard Data: Mapped services: 9 services
📊 Service Translation Services - Using API data: bookings = 3, revenue = 240
🔍 Service Card Data: {booking_count: 3, total_revenue: 240}
📊 Services Stats Calculation: {totalRevenueFromServices: 6400}
```

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Each service card shows booking count (e.g., "3 bookings")
- [ ] Stats header shows "Total Revenue: OMR 6,400"
- [ ] "Top Performing Services" shows revenue values

#### Company Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/company`

**Look for:**
```
📊 Fetching services for owner IDs: [...]
✅ Found services: 9
✅ Found bookings: 20
```

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Shows "9" in Services box
- [ ] Shows "20" in Bookings box

#### Earnings Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/provider/earnings`

**Look for:**
```
⚠️ No payments found, calculating earnings from invoices
(or)
⚠️ No invoices found, checking bookings for amounts
✅ Set earnings from bookings: 20 items
📊 Total earnings calculated: 6400 from 20 earnings
```

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Total Earnings shows OMR 6,400
- [ ] Monthly Earnings shows non-zero value
- [ ] Charts are populated

#### Messages Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/messages`

**Look for:**
```
📨 Fetching messages for conversation: ...
✅ Fetched messages: X messages
```

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Click conversation → messages appear immediately
- [ ] Loading spinner shows briefly
- [ ] No "No messages yet" if conversation has messages

#### Notifications Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/notifications`

**Look for:**
```
📊 Calculating notification stats from X notifications
📊 Unread notifications: X out of Y
✅ Notification stats calculated: {total: Y, unread: X}
```

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Unread count shows actual number (not 0)
- [ ] Updates when marking notifications as read

## ⚠️ Warnings & Errors (Non-Critical)

### React Controlled/Uncontrolled Warnings

**Warning:** "Select/Checkbox is changing from uncontrolled to controlled"

**Impact:** None - purely development warnings  
**Cause:** Components receive undefined then defined values  
**Fix if Needed:** Initialize state values with empty strings instead of undefined  
**Priority:** Low - doesn't affect functionality

### Notification Settings Error

**Error:** `Could not find the 'booking_notifications' column of 'notification_settings'`

**Impact:** Notification settings page might not save all preferences  
**Cause:** Database table missing column  
**Fix Needed:** Database migration to add column  
**Priority:** Medium - Settings page feature incomplete

**SQL Fix** (if needed):
```sql
ALTER TABLE notification_settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS booking_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Scenario 1: My Services Still Shows 0

**Check Console:**
- Is API returning booking_count? Look for: `📊 Sample service being returned`
- Is dashboard-data preserving it? Look for: "Using API data" vs "Calculating locally"
- Are service cards receiving it? Look for: `🔍 Service Card Data`

**If API returns 0:**
- Bookings might not have service_id in database
- Need to link bookings to services

### Scenario 2: Company Still Shows 0 Services

**Check Console:**
- Look for: `✅ Found services: X`
- If shows 0, check ownerIds array

**If ownerIds is empty:**
- Company owner_id might not match provider user ID
- Need to verify company→profile relationship

### Scenario 3: Earnings Still Shows 0

**Check Console:**
- Should see fallback logs: "No payments found, calculating from invoices"
- Or: "checking bookings for amounts"
- Then: "Total earnings calculated: X"

**If still 0:**
- No invoices OR bookings have amounts
- Check: Do invoices have amount field populated?
- Check: Do bookings have total_amount field populated?

## 📝 Console Commands to Debug

### Check Service Data
```javascript
// Run in console on My Services page
const services = document.querySelector('[data-services]')
console.table(services)
```

### Check Network Requests
1. Open Network tab
2. Filter: `/api/services`
3. Click request
4. Check "Response" tab
5. Verify booking_count and total_revenue are present

### Check Component State (React DevTools)
1. Install React DevTools
2. Find `ServicesStats` component
3. Inspect props: `services` array
4. Check if services have booking_count and total_revenue

---

## 🎯 Expected Console Output (Success)

When everything is working, console should show:

```
✅ Services API: Calculated booking counts for 9 services
📊 Services API: Booking counts map: {uuid1: 3, uuid2: 5, uuid3: 2...}
✅ Services API: Calculated revenue for 9 services
📊 Services API: Revenue map: {uuid1: 240, uuid2: 1500, uuid3: 160...}
📊 Sample service being returned: {booking_count: 3, total_revenue: 240}
📊 Dashboard Data: Loaded services from API: 9 services
📊 Dashboard Data: Calculating/preserving service booking counts
📊 Service Translation Services - Using API data: bookings = 3, revenue = 240
📊 Services Page: Data loaded - 9 services
🔍 Service Card Data: {booking_count: 3, total_revenue: 240}
📊 Services Stats Calculation: {totalRevenueFromServices: 6400}
```

## 🔧 Quick Fixes (If Needed)

### If Controlled/Uncontrolled Warnings Appear

These don't affect functionality but if you want to fix them:

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// Before (causes warning)
const [value, setValue] = useState()

// After (no warning)
const [value, setValue] = useState('')
```

**Files to update:**
- Any Select or Checkbox components showing warnings
- Initialize with empty string '' instead of undefined

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the live site** with hard refresh
2. **Check console logs** - Share any relevant output
3. **Verify each page** shows correct data
4. **Report results** - Which pages working, which not

If all pages now show correct data:
- ✅ All fixes successful!
- 🎉 Dashboard improvements complete!

If some pages still show 0:
- Share console logs
- Share Network tab screenshots
- I'll provide additional debugging steps
