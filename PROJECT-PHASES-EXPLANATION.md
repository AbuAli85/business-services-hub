# Project Phases System - Complete Explanation 📋

## What are Project Phases?

Project Phases are **major milestones** that break down your complex project into manageable, sequential chunks. Each phase represents a significant deliverable or stage in your project's lifecycle.

## How the System Works

### 🎯 **Phase Structure**
- **Sequential Flow**: Phases are designed to be completed in order
- **Clear Deliverables**: Each phase has specific goals and outcomes
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show completion status
- **Time Management**: Estimated vs actual hours for better planning

### 📊 **Phase Status Indicators**

| Status | Color | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Pending** | Gray | Not started yet | Click "Start Phase" to begin |
| **In Progress** | Blue | Currently working on it | Continue tasks, track time |
| **Completed** | Green | Finished successfully | Move to next phase |
| **Overdue** | Red | Past due date | Prioritize and catch up |

### 🔄 **Phase Lifecycle**

```
1. Pending → 2. In Progress → 3. Completed
     ↑              ↓              ↓
     └─── (Can restart if needed) ──┘
```

## Visual Elements Explained

### 📈 **Progress Bar**
- **Color-coded**: Changes color based on completion percentage

- **Visual feedback**: Easy to see at a glance

### 📋 **Task Information**
