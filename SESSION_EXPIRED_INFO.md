# Session Expired - Authentication Required

## Current Status

Your authentication session has **expired** or **been cleared**. The middleware logs show:

```
cookieCount: 0
cookieNames: []
hasAccessToken: false
hasRefreshToken: false
message: 'No token found'
```

## What This Means

You need to **sign in again** at: https://marketing.thedigitalmorph.com/auth/sign-in

## Why Did This Happen?

Your previous session showed it would expire at: **10/7/2025, 11:05:48 PM**

Possible reasons for session loss:
1. ✅ **Session expired naturally** (JWT tokens expire after a certain time)
2. 🍪 **Cookies cleared** (browser settings, incognito mode, manual clear)
3. 🔄 **Browser restart** with settings that don't preserve cookies
4. 🌐 **Domain/subdomain navigation** causing cookie scope issues
5. 🔧 **Supabase session refresh failed** (network issues, server errors)

## What the Middleware is Doing

The middleware is working **correctly**:
1. ✅ Detecting that you have no authentication cookies
2. ✅ Logging the missing cookie state
3. ✅ Redirecting you to `/auth/sign-in` as expected
4. ✅ Protecting dashboard routes from unauthorized access

## How to Resolve

### Step 1: Sign In Again
1. Go to: https://marketing.thedigitalmorph.com/auth/sign-in
2. Enter your email: `luxsess2001@hotmail.com`
3. Enter your password
4. Click "Sign In"

### Step 2: Verify Cookies Are Set
After signing in, check browser console for:
```
✅ Supabase client connected successfully with active session
👤 User ID: d2ce1fe9-806f-4dbc-8efb-9cf160f19e4b
🔄 Session expires: [new expiration time]
```

### Step 3: Check Cookies in DevTools
Open DevTools → Application → Cookies → Your Domain

You should see:
- `sb-access-token`
- `sb-refresh-token`
- `sb-reootcngcptfogfozlmz-auth-token.0`
- `sb-reootcngcptfogfozlmz-auth-token.1`

## Enhanced Debugging

The middleware now includes enhanced cookie debugging that will log:
- Total cookie count
- All cookie names
- Cookie header content (first 100 chars)
- Supabase-specific auth tokens
- Whether access/refresh tokens are present

This will help diagnose any future cookie issues.

## Prevention Tips

To avoid frequent re-logins:

1. **Don't clear browser data** while using the app
2. **Stay logged in** - the session auto-refreshes if you're active
3. **Use standard browsing mode** (not incognito/private)
4. **Keep the tab active** - inactive tabs may not refresh sessions
5. **Check browser cookie settings** - ensure cookies are not being automatically cleared

## Technical Details

### Cookie Scope
Supabase sets cookies with these parameters:
- **Domain**: Your app domain
- **Path**: `/`
- **HttpOnly**: true (for security)
- **Secure**: true (HTTPS only)
- **SameSite**: `lax`

### Session Lifecycle
- **Initial login**: Sets auth tokens in cookies
- **Auto-refresh**: Supabase client automatically refreshes before expiration
- **Expiration**: Default is 1 hour, refresh token extends this
- **Logout**: Clears all auth cookies

## What Changed in This Fix

### Dashboard Loading Fixes (Previous)
- ✅ Fixed infinite loading states
- ✅ Added proper role-based redirects
- ✅ Enhanced error handling

### Middleware Logging Enhancement (Current)
- ✅ Added detailed cookie inspection
- ✅ Added cookie header logging
- ✅ Added Supabase-specific token detection
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging

## Files Modified
- `middleware.ts` - Enhanced cookie debugging and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Sign in** to your account
2. **Verify** the dashboard loads correctly
3. **Monitor** the browser console for any cookie-related warnings
4. **Report** any persistent authentication issues

Your authentication system is working correctly - you just need to sign in again!
