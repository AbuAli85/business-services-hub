-- Final fix for client company display
-- Based on the data structure we found:
-- - Some clients have company_id but empty company_name
-- - Some clients have no company at all
-- - We need to join with companies table to get the actual company name

-- First, let's check what's in the companies table

LIMIT 5;

-- Now fix the v_booking_status view to properly handle client companies
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_booking_status CASCADE;

-- Create the v_booking_status view with proper client company handling
