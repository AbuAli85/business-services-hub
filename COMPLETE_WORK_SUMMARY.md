## üîß What Was Fixed (Technical Details)

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Services not showing revenue**: API wasn't calculating total_revenue per service
2. **Bookings showing 0**: Used empty array instead of API summaryStats during loading
3. **Earnings showing 0**: Only checked payments table, not invoices or bookings
4. **Company showing 0 services**: Query used company_id instead of provider_id
5. **Dashboard overwriting API data**: calculateServiceBookingCounts method overwrote API values
6. **Messages not syncing**: Didn't clear messages array when switching conversations
7. **Notifications count wrong**: Stats calculated from service instead of state
8. **Loading showing zeros**: No skeleton loaders during async operations
9. **Empty states unhelpful**: No guidance or action buttons
10. **Notification settings errors**: Tried to save columns that don't exist in database

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Services API**: Added revenue aggregation from bookings table
2. **Bookings page**: Check loading state and use API stats
3. **Earnings page**: Fallback chain (payments ‚Üí invoices ‚Üí bookings)
4. **Company page**: Query by provider_id (owner_id)
5. **Dashboard data**: Preserve API data, only calculate if missing
6. **Messages**: Clear array on conversation switch + loading state
7. **Notifications**: Calculate from state + update on change
8. **Loading states**: Skeleton components for Services and Earnings
9. **Empty states**: Helpful prompts + CTA buttons
10. **Notification settings**: Only save existing columns + map typo field
