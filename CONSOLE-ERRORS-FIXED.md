# üîß Console Errors Fixed - Complete Guide

## ‚ùå Issues Identified

Based on the console logs, the following errors were occurring:

### 1. Storage Bucket Not Found Error
```
Error uploading image: StorageApiError: Bucket not found
```
**Root Cause**: The application was trying to use a `'public'` storage bucket that doesn't exist in Supabase.

**Files Affected**:
- `app/dashboard/services/create/page.tsx` (line 206, 212)
- `app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx` (line 308, 314)

### 2. Service Creation API Error
```
Error creating service: Object
```
**Root Cause**: The services table was missing required columns that the create service form was trying to insert.

**Missing Columns**:
- `terms_conditions`
- `cancellation_policy` 
- `approval_status`
- `tags`

### 3. Missing Storage Buckets
The application needed proper storage buckets for different file types but they weren't created.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Storage Bucket Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/051_create_storage_buckets.sql`

This migration creates all necessary storage buckets:
- `service-images` - For service cover images (5MB limit)
- `avatars` - For user profile pictures (2MB limit)  
- `message-files` - For file attachments in messages (10MB limit)
- `company-assets` - For company logos and assets (5MB limit)

### 2. Fixed Code to Use Correct Buckets
**Services Creation Page**:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
.from('public')

// After (correct)  
.from('service-images')
```

**Messages Page**:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
.from('public')

// After (correct)
.from('message-files')
```

### 3. Added Missing Service Table Columns
**File**: `supabase/migrations/052_add_missing_service_columns.sql`

Added missing columns to the services table:
- `terms_conditions` (TEXT)
- `cancellation_policy` (TEXT)
- `approval_status` (TEXT, default: 'pending')
- `tags` (TEXT[])

### 4. Created Database Fix Script
**File**: `fix-database-issues.js`

A Node.js script that:
- Creates all required storage buckets
- Adds missing database columns
- Tests the fixes
- Provides clear feedback

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies if not already installed
npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv

# Run the fix script
node fix-database-issues.js
```

### Option 2: Apply Migrations Manually
```bash
# Apply the new migrations
npx supabase db push

# Or apply specific migrations
npx supabase migration up --include-all
```

### Option 3: Manual Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage section
3. Create the following buckets manually:
   - `service-images` (public, 5MB limit)
   - `avatars` (public, 2MB limit)
   - `message-files` (public, 10MB limit)
   - `company-assets` (public, 5MB limit)

## üîç Verification Steps

After applying the fixes:

1. **Check Storage Buckets**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
   - Verify all 4 buckets exist and are public

2. **Test Image Upload**:
   - Try creating a service with an image
   - Check console for any remaining errors

3. **Test Service Creation**:
   - Try creating a new service
   - Verify all fields save correctly

4. **Check Database Schema**:
   - Verify services table has all required columns
   - Check that new services can be created

## üìã Storage Bucket Details

| Bucket Name | Purpose | File Size Limit | File Types |
|-------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| `service-images` | Service cover images | 5MB | PNG, JPEG, JPG, WebP |
| `avatars` | User profile pictures | 2MB | PNG, JPEG, JPG, WebP |
| `message-files` | Message attachments | 10MB | Images, PDF, Word docs, text |
| `company-assets` | Company logos/assets | 5MB | PNG, JPEG, JPG, SVG |

## üîí Security Policies

Each storage bucket has proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies:
- **Upload**: Only authenticated users can upload
- **View**: Public access for viewing
- **Update**: Users can only update their own files
- **Delete**: Users can only delete their own files

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Bucket not found" still appears
**Solution**: Ensure the migration ran successfully and buckets were created.

### Issue: "Permission denied" on upload
**Solution**: Check that RLS policies are properly set and user is authenticated.

### Issue: Service creation still fails
**Solution**: Verify all required columns exist in the services table.

### Issue: Images not displaying
**Solution**: Check that bucket is public and policies allow viewing.

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the Supabase dashboard for any error logs
2. Verify all migrations were applied successfully
3. Test with a fresh browser session
4. Check browser console for any new error messages

## üéØ Expected Results

After applying all fixes:
- ‚úÖ Image uploads should work without errors
- ‚úÖ Service creation should complete successfully
- ‚úÖ No more "Bucket not found" errors
- ‚úÖ All form fields should save correctly
- ‚úÖ Storage buckets should be accessible and functional
