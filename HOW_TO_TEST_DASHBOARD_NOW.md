## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Dashboard Still Reloading

**Check 1: Is localStorage cleared?**
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.getItem('dashboard-live-mode')
// Should return: null

// If it returns 'true', run:
localStorage.removeItem('dashboard-live-mode')
location.reload()
```

**Check 2: Is sessionStorage cleared?**
```javascript
// In console:
sessionStorage.length
// Should return: 0

// If not, run:
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

**Check 3: Check console for patterns**
```javascript
// Look for these RED FLAGS:
"🔄 Auto-refresh triggered" → Auto-refresh is running (shouldn't happen)
"🏠 Provider dashboard mounted" (multiple times) → Component remounting
"📡 Data change detected" (rapidly repeating) → Real-time issue
```

### Problem: Dashboard Stuck on Loading

**Solution**:
```javascript
// 1. Clear everything:
sessionStorage.clear()
localStorage.clear()

// 2. Check if you're authenticated:
// Go to browser DevTools > Application > Cookies
// Look for supabase cookies (sb-*-auth-token)

// 3. If no cookies, sign in again

// 4. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### Problem: React Error or Crash

**Solution**:
```bash
# This shouldn't happen with latest fixes
# If it does, check the deployment:

# 1. Verify latest commit is deployed
git log -1 --oneline
# Should show: a7ea4c0 or later

# 2. Force new deployment:
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# 3. Clear browser cache completely
# 4. Try again in an incognito window
```

### Problem: Data Not Loading

**Check**: 
1. Open Network tab in DevTools
2. Look for failed API requests (red entries)
3. Check if Supabase is accessible
4. Verify your database connection

## 📊 What You Should See

### Console Logs (Normal Behavior)
```bash
# On initial load:
🏠 Provider dashboard mounted
🔐 Checking authentication...
✅ User authenticated: provider@example.com | Role: provider
👤 Provider user confirmed, loading data...
✅ Data loaded successfully

# If React Strict Mode is on (development only):
⏭️ Already initializing or initialized, skipping

# That's it! Console should be quiet after this.
```

### Console Logs (Problem Indicators)
```bash
# ❌ BAD - Shouldn't see these:
🔄 Auto-refresh triggered → Auto-refresh is active (bug)
🏠 Provider dashboard mounted (repeated many times) → Remounting
📡 Data change detected (every few seconds) → Too frequent
❌ Auth check failed → Authentication issue
⚠️ Error fetching provider data → Data loading issue
```
